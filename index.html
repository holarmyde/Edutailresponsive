                    <p>The tourism industry has considerable potential to be a sustainability role model in its role as
                        a buyer of goods and other services, from building materials and green construction standards to

                        private space station, including in-space manufacturing, microgravity research, and tourism -
                        for both individuals and sovereign nation astronauts - and in-space supply logistics.
